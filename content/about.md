## `Whoami`

Hello, I'm Younes, a Cybersecurity and Cloud Engineering student based in Casablanca, Morocco.



## `Purpose` 

This blog documents my technical progression as I refine my specialization. It serves as a lab for documenting my projects and sharing my insights gained during my transition from a student to an engineer.
